## Toilet Tower Defense: A Deeper Look at the Flushed Battlefield

This repository contains a script designed to enhance your experience in Toilet Tower Defense, the popular Roblox game where you defend your toilet throne against waves of increasingly ridiculous enemies. This script is not about gaining an unfair advantage; it's about gaining a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics and environment.

### Unveiling the Secrets: Tools for Strategic Defense

* **Game Mechanics Insight:**  Learn more about the game's mechanics, including enemy weaknesses, tower upgrades, and the importance of strategic placement.
